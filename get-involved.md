# Get Involved

GeoZarr welcomes contributions from anyone — OGC membership is not required.

## Start Here

The best way to get involved is through GitHub:

1. **Browse open issues** to find topics that interest you
2. **Comment on issues** or open a new one to propose ideas
3. **Submit a pull request** — review the contributing guide below first

[GitHub: zarr-developers/geozarr-spec](https://github.com/zarr-developers/geozarr-spec)

## Contributing

- **Review the [roadmap](/roadmap)** to understand current priorities and open work items
- **Keep changes focused** — avoid modifying multiple sections at once; use issues for discussion before large updates
- **Branch in the main repo** for visible collaborative work
- **PRs are reviewed async on GitHub** and merged by SWG chairs when rough consensus is reached
- **Datasets** can be contributed to [geozarr-examples](https://github.com/developmentseed/geozarr-examples)
