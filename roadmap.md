# V1 Roadmap

The SWG approved a V1 roadmap at the February 2026 meeting. The target is OAB review by **summer 2026**.

GeoZarr V1 is built on three modular, composable Zarr conventions:

| Convention | Repo |
|------------|------|
| **geo-proj** (`proj:`) | [zarr-conventions/geo-proj](https://github.com/zarr-conventions/geo-proj) |
| **spatial** (`spatial:`) | [zarr-conventions/spatial](https://github.com/zarr-conventions/spatial) |
| **multiscales** | [zarr-conventions/multiscales](https://github.com/zarr-conventions/multiscales) |

## Milestone 1: Release Candidate

**Exit Criteria:**

- All three conventions finalized
- Conformance classes defined
- Normative language (RFC 2119) applied throughout
- JSON Schemas stable and validated
- At least 3 implementations documented (Candidate maturity)
- Code owner designated for each convention
- Test dataset suite available
- Documentation complete (quickstart, composition guide, compatibility matrix)

## Milestone 2: Architecture Board Review

**Target:** Summer 2026
